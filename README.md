# Over the fence Front End
Inspired by whatsapp but in more of a community message board form. Users can send messages like they would in a texting application but instead of
sending  to a friend or group messages post for everyone to see.

## Planning Story
I started by drawing up Wireframes and ERDs to get the idea of where to start and how to go about certain things.
once that was done I moved onto setting up the backend models and routes testing the curl-scripts along the way to make sure the routes and paths did and went to where I wanted. Once that was all done I set up basic styling on the front end to get an idea of the flow of the project and what tasks to tackle first. Once that was set up I started piecing everything together.
